# HEARTBEAT.md -- Heartbeat Checklist

Run this checklist on every heartbeat. This covers your local planning and memory work as well as the work assigned to you in AgentDash.

## 1. Identity and Context

- `GET /api/agents/me` -- confirm your id, role, budget, chainOfCommand.
- Check wake context: `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID`.

## 2. Local Planning Check

1. Read today's plan from `./memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` under "## Today's Plan".
2. Review each planned item: what's completed, what's blocked, and what up next.
3. For any blockers, resolve them yourself or escalate to your steward.
4. If you're ahead, start on the next highest priority.
5. Record progress updates in the daily notes.

## 3. Approval Follow-Up

If `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` is set:

- Review the approval and its linked issues.
- Close resolved issues or comment on what remains open.

## 4. Get Assignments

- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={your-id}&status=todo,in_progress,blocked`
- Prioritize: `in_progress` first, then `todo`. Skip `blocked` unless you can unblock it.
- If there is already an active run on an `in_progress` task, just move on to the next thing.
- If `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` is set and assigned to you, prioritize that task.

## 5. Checkout and Work

- Always checkout before working: `POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout`.
- Never retry a 409 -- that task belongs to someone else.
- Do the work. Update status and comment when done.

## 6. Delegating (only when you should)

- Default to doing the work yourself. Delegate only when the task genuinely
  needs a capability you do not have, or splits into parts that can run in
  parallel and are each substantial on their own.
- When you do delegate, create subtasks with `POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues`. Always set `parentId` and `goalId`. For non-child follow-ups that must stay on the same checkout/worktree, set `inheritExecutionWorkspaceFromIssueId` to the source issue.
- Brief the assignee properly the first time. A vague subtask comes straight back.

## 7. Fact Extraction

1. Check for new conversations since last extraction.
2. Extract durable facts to the relevant entity in `./life/` (PARA).
3. Update `./memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with timeline entries.
4. Update access metadata (timestamp, access_count) for any referenced facts.

## 8. Exit

- Comment on any in_progress work before exiting.
- If no assignments and no valid mention-handoff, exit cleanly.

## Working for your steward

- Your steward is accountable for what you do. Keep them able to answer for it:
  say what you did, in their words, where they will see it.
- Unblocking: resolve what you can, escalate what needs a human decision.
- Budget awareness: above 80% spend, work only on what is critical.
- Never look for unassigned work -- only work on what is assigned to you.
- Never cancel someone else's task -- comment and reassign instead.

## Rules

- Always use the AgentDash skill for coordination.
- Always include `X-Paperclip-Run-Id` header on mutating API calls.
- Comment in concise markdown: status line + bullets + links.
- Self-assign via checkout only when explicitly @-mentioned.
